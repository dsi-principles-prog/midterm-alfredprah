# YouTube Trending Video Statistics
YouTube (the world-famous video sharing website) maintains a list of the top trending videos on the platform. 

My dataset includes the YouTube video title, channel title, publish time, tags, views, likes and dislikes, description, and 
comment count. Data is included for the US, GB, DE, CA, and FR regions (USA, Great Britain, Germany, Canada, and France, 
respectively), with up to 200 listed trending videos per day. For the purposes of this assignment, I focus on only the videos
that trend in the United States of America: "USvideos.csv"

My goal is to use the available data to predict the day and time of the week that has the most trending videos.
