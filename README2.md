# YouTube Trending Video Statistics

YouTube (the world-famous video sharing website) maintains a list of the top trending videos on the platform. 

This dataset includes the YouTube video title, channel title, publish time, tags, views, likes and dislikes, description, and comment count. Data is included for the US, GB, DE, CA, and FR regions (USA, Great Britain, Germany, Canada, and France, 
respectively), with up to 200 listed trending videos per day. For the purposes of this assignment, I focus on only the YouTube videos that trend in the United States of America: "USvideos.csv" (data set included in repository).

My goal is to use the available data to predict the duration of popularity of a video. Ie, how long will a video that is currently trending in the U.S, remain on the list of trending videos? YouTube is a "numbers" game knowing this can help YouTubers to not only aspire to have their videos Trend, but to have them to Trend for as long as possible.
