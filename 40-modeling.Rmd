## Modeling

It is time to prepare my data for modeling.

The parameters of input are: 
 - category ID
 - trending date
 - publish time
 - views
 - likes
 - dislikes
 - comment_count
 - comments_disabled
 - ratings_disabled
 
 The new column I will be predicting is "duration". 
 
 
### Add new features to the original data set: 
```{r}
video_statistics_prepared <- video_statistics %>%
  assign_values_to_days_of_the_week() %>%
  time_of_upload() %>%
  time_of_day_of_upload() %>%
  assign_binary_values_to_time_of_day_of_upload()
```

### Re-arrange columns and select parameters of interest 
```{r}
video_statistics_prepared <- video_statistics_prepared %>%
  select (
    week_day,
    time_of_day,
    morning,
    afternoon,
    evening,
    night,
    category_id,
    views,
    likes,
    dislikes,
    comment_count,
    comments_disabled,
    ratings_disabled
  )


#Inspect data:
head(video_statistics_prepared)
```
